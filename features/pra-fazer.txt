pra fazer:

check whether log player error and that sort of function is really necessary

maybe handle procedure output in SQL_prep_stmt_result() instead of function SQL_prep_procedure()

remove unnecessary id from composite primary key tables

maybe use $_SESSION vars to take user message beyond redirects
maybe try alert() -> REDIRECT()
