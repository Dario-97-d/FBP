The football player game

This is meant to become a web browser-based non-animated game, meant to allow for a simple maths based representation of the development of a football player along with club management features.

The ideia: a player will run a character with football player attributes and play multiplayer features.
These features include:
- PVP challenge
- Team games
- Club development
- Mail
- Mates
- Etc

Each player may assume a role in the management of the club. Such roles could include the management of several features to be developed, such as:
- Team training
- Team play and players selection
- Players' contracts
- Players' transfers
- Club finances
- Etc.

## 2017 - 2020

The first version was developed as a hobbie off and on from 2017 to 2020. The code is shrunk to as few lines as possible to make it easy to find any piece of code, as long as one has a sense of the whole codebase.

## 2024 March - July

Between march and july of 2024, the codebase was updated to a more advanced paradigm, using some concepts of Object-oriented Programming. Some features were updated or further developed.
