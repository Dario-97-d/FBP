The football player game

This is a web browser non animated game, meant to allow for a simple maths based representation of the development of a football player. The ideia is: a player will run a character with football player attributes and multiplayer football-related features. These features include PVP challenges, team games and club development, where each player may assume a role in the management of the club. Such roles could encompass the management of several features to be developed in game, such as training, team play and players selection, team players' contracts, players' transfers, club finances, etc.
